# Personal Projects

### Personal Homelab Environment
This is my personal homelab! It is currently a work-in-progress (WIP) as I will continually upgrade it. 

### Utilities 

-**Rackmate T1 (8U)** (Server Rack) 

-**Icy Dock 6-Bay 2.5" SATA Enclsoure** -- WIP ðŸš§

-**Dell Optiplex 3060** (Will run Proxmox VE, a free hypervisor installed from a bootable USB. Used to create virtual machines (VMs) and LXC containers for sandboxed environments like malware testing or OS/application experimentation. Managed via a browser-based web UI over your local network.)

-**Dell Optiplex 3070** (Also running Proxmox VE. This node will host Docker contaienrs or VMs for services like a media server (Jellyfin), game servers (TBD), or self-hosted tools (e.g., Bookstack, Portainer). Network services and RDP access will be enabled for remote access from other devices on LAN.)

-**Managed PoE 8-Port Switch** 
(Used as your primary network switch, connecting all devices via Cat6 Ethernet cables. It supports VLAN configuration, port isolation, and traffic monitoring via its web interface. Although PoE is not needed yet, it prepares myself for future PoE-capable devices like IP cameras or Raspberry Pi with PoE HATs.)

-**KVM Switch** (Enables local control of both Optiplexes using one monitor, keyboard, and mouse. I'll physically connect the KVM to each Optiplex via HDMI/DisplayPort and USB, allowing you to toggle between machines during OS installations and maintenance.)

## TBD equipment: 

-**Motherboard: ITX** (ASRock J5040-ITX or newer alternative) - (Acts as the dedicated system board for my NAS/server node, hosting TrueNAS SCALE (an open-soruce NAS OS based on Debian with ZFS support - TrueNAS - ZFS - Web UI Management - SMB/NFS shares - possible RAID)

# Cont. Projects... (see github repositories)

### SIEM in Microsoft Azure (_Sentinel_)
Deployed Azure Virtual Machine with Windows 10 Pro, configuring network security settings and firewall rules to simulate real-world cyber threat scenarios. Integrated Log Analytics Workspace with VM, enabling comprehensive monitoring and logging security events. Utilized PowerShell script to extract geolocation data from failed RDP logon attempts, applying an IP geolocation API to map the source of security threats. Visualized attack sources by leveraging Azure Sentinel to create dynamic maps showing the origins of failed RDP attempts, providing actionable intelligence on threat patterns. 

### Active Directory Home Lab (_Windows_) 
Implemented Active Directory Domain Services on Windows Server 2019, creating a fully functional domain controller with a virtualized environment. Configured network settings to support internal and NAT networking, enabling secure and isolated lab scenarios for testing and development. Automated user creation using PowerShell scripts, enhancing administrative efficiency, and demonstrating script skills. Established and validated network connectivity and domain membership for Windows 10 client machine, ensuring seamless integration and operation within the domain. 

### File System Watcher (_PowerShell_) 
Implemented a System.IO.FileSystemWatcher object to continuously monitor changes within the directory, including file modifications, creations, deletions, and renaming. Utilized PowerShell event handling to execute custom responses to file system events, ensuring immediate notification and logging of critical file changes. Demonstrated the scriptâ€™s effectiveness through a series of controlled tests, verifying the scripâ€™s capability to detect and report file changes accurately. 

### Minecraft Pi via (_Raspberry Pi OS_) 
Developed and executed Python scripts to perform various tasks within Minecraft, such as sending messages, manipulating player position, and altering the game environment. Implemented advanced game modifications, including creating structures and experimenting with game physics through code. Demonstrated ability to troubleshoot and resolve issues related to both software and hardware configurations.
